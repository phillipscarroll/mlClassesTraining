# Restarting Entire Course

Restarting the course since I had way to much time off between the middle of section 4 and now. 

# Local vs Google Colab

I like some aspects of google colab but decided on running this lab locally so I always have access to cuda cores. Eventually I will move this off my production work PC and onto one of my workstations that act as servers for the home network. I have 24GB of cuda gpu available on one of those servers right now, this would make a decent lab even on the Pascal architecture. 

# Time away

If I spend time away and feel that there has been to long a disconnect I will simply restart that full section, which means with this course that could be up to 4-5 hours of videos and training. The punishment of the iterative process is really only a benefit.

# Frequency

I should be completing 2 sections minimum per day no matter what, that is essentially 10-25 minutes of video, or roughly 30-45 minutes of total training with notes and labs.
